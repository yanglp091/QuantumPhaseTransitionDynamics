# QuantumPhaseTransitionDynamics
This is a matlab code to calculate the dynamics of a single-photon pulse triggered first-order quantum phase transition.


The matlab toolbox for quantum optics is needed: https://github.com/jevonlongdell/qotoolbox

The codes for Matrix exponential times a vector is need: https://github.com/higham/expmv
